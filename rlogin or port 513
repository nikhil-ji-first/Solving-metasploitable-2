Penetration Testing Report – Metasploitable2 (Port 513 - rlogin)

1. Test Date : 22 -06-25 
2. Target Information
- Target IP: 192.168.1.101
- Target System: Metasploitable2 (Ubuntu-based)
- Service: rlogin
- Port: 513/tcp

3. Reconnaissance

3.1 Nmap Scan
Command:
nmap -sS -sV -p 513 192.168.1.101

Output:
PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION
513/tcp open  login   Linux rlogin daemon

Interpretation:
The rlogin service is running and accessible on the target.

4. Enumeration

rlogin is a legacy service that does not require a password if trust is established via `.rhosts` or `/etc/hosts.equiv`.
We checked for misconfiguration allowing unauthorized access.

We attempted to connect using the rlogin command:
rlogin 192.168.1.101 -l root

Result:
If `.rhosts` or trust entries were misconfigured, this granted shell access as the `root` user without authentication.

Additional test:
Created spoofed entries in local `.rhosts` to impersonate trusted hosts and connected to the target using a spoofed IP.

5. Exploitation

The service was exploited by connecting via rlogin without authentication due to a trust misconfiguration.

Steps:
1. Spoof trusted IP or use a host already trusted by target
2. Use command:
   rlogin 192.168.1.101 -l root

Result:
- Login succeeded without password
- Remote root shell obtained

6. Post-Exploitation

After successful login:
- Command executed: `whoami` → root
- Enumerated system details: `uname -a`, `ifconfig`, `cat /etc/passwd`
- Demonstrated full system access and potential for lateral movement

Persistence:
- The attacker can maintain access by modifying `.rhosts` or planting reverse shells

7. Recommendations

- Disable rlogin service entirely if not needed
  * Comment out or remove from `/etc/inetd.conf` or `/etc/xinetd.d`
- Remove `.rhosts` and `/etc/hosts.equiv` trust files
- Replace with SSH for secure remote login
- Apply firewall rules to block port 513/tcp
- Monitor logs for unauthorized access attempts
- Regularly audit for legacy services and unused ports

8. Conclusion

Port 513 (rlogin) on Metasploitable2 was vulnerable due to trust-based misconfiguration. 
This allowed unauthenticated root access from a remote attacker. 
This highlights the severe risk posed by legacy services and underscores the importance of service deprecation and strict access control.
