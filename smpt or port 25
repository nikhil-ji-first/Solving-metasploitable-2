Penetration Testing Report: Metasploitable 2 â€“ Port 25 (SMTP)

Target: Metasploitable 2
IP Address: 192.168.1.101
Port: 25 (SMTP)
Date: 2025-06-15
Tested By: [ ME ]






1. Port Scanning and Service Identification

Tool Used: nmap
Command: nmap -sV -p25  192.168.56.101         or use (-A) for aggresive scan  

Output:
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
25/tcp open  smtp    Postfix smtpd

Findings:
- Port 25 is open and running Postfix SMTP.
- The server is not using encryption (no SMTPS or STARTTLS detected).
- No authentication mechanism is immediately enforced.







2. Banner Grabbing and Enumeration

Tool Used: telnet, netcat, smtp-user-enum

Command: telnet 192.168.56.101 25
Response:
220 metasploitable.localdomain ESMTP Postfix (Ubuntu)

SMTP Enumeration:
smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt -t 192.168.56.101

Results:
- Users such as root, user, msfadmin are enumerated successfully using the VRFY command.

Vulnerability Identified:
- User Enumeration via VRFY Command








3. Exploitation

Metasploit Module Used:
- auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum

Commands:
use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.101
set USER_FILE /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames.txt
run

Result:
- Successfully enumerated existing system users via SMTP.

Note: While not a remote code execution vulnerability, user enumeration is a critical reconnaissance tool in real-world attacks.











4. Impact

- Information Disclosure: Attackers can determine valid system usernames.
- Facilitates Further Attacks: Usernames can be used in brute force  attacks.
- Misconfiguration: Lack of security controls such as disabling VRFY and EXPN commands.





5. Recommendations

1. Disable VRFY and EXPN Commands:
   Modify Postfix configuration (main.cf):
     disable_vrfy_command = yes
   Reload Postfix:
     service postfix reload

2. Implement Authentication and Encryption:
   Enable STARTTLS and SMTP AUTH to prevent unauthorized access.

3. Limit Access to SMTP Service:
   Use firewall rules to restrict port 25 to known, trusted IPs.

4. Monitor SMTP Logs:
   Regularly check logs for unusual activity and brute-force attempts.






Summary

 Vulnerability             Exploitability   Recommendation               

| VRFY User Enumeration  | Easy           | Disable VRFY command            |
| Lack of Encryption     | Moderate       | Enable STARTTLS and enforce TLS |
| Open SMTP to the World | Moderate       | Restrict via firewall or ACL    |





Conclusion

The SMTP service on Metasploitable 2 presents multiple misconfigurations that allow user enumeration and insecure communication. While no direct remote code execution was discovered via port 25, the exposed information significantly aids in further penetration activities.
